# IIRFilters_group7

In this project we will demonstrate the utility of IIR filters for use in 
frequency selection. 

# MP05: Note Detection 

Running mp05/toneDetect.m will cycle through the .wav files found in ./mp05 
The output is how many half-steps away a note is from the root note (Note02.wav)
if no note is detected, -1 is returned. 

# MP06: Simple Song Detection

Running mp06/simpleSongDetection.m will return the note played
(similar to how they are represented in Note Detect, see line 9)
during a 100 ms interval. 

# ECG Interference

Running ECGInterferenceRemoval/Lab_Exercise/Verification_Page.m will 
display a ECG scan prior to removing the 60 Hz coupling from electrical 
power.
